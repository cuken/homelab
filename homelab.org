#+FILETAGS: HOMELAB PERSONAL


* OBJECTIVE

** TODO Move project structure into github and replace existing repo in GITHUB
SCHEDULED: <2023-06-19 Mon>
*** TODO Symlink Homelab.org into README.org
*** TODO Remove github repo of old homelab (I wish I knew enough git to fix all of this.)
*** TODO Setup new git repo (use magit so we can finally learn it here)
*** TODO create first commit messages
** TODO Figure out how to do automatic git commits and tracking on the hour?
** Setup Kickoff image
*** NEXT Validate Proxmox is ready for automation
SCHEDULED: <2023-06-18 Sun 23:30>
*** TODO Generate a kickoff image to start the automation process
**** This image will serve as the starting point for the automation of the lab
**** We need this to be generated before we are able to automate into proxmox
***** Initial thoughts: Create something that can be quickly pulled into any new machine to start the setup of the lab
***** QUESTION: Should we have this image set up proxmox as well?
****** Proxmox in my lab runs on bare metal, so getting this to install on an unbooted box probably isn't worth it
**** TODO Identify tools needed for this 'kickoff' image
***** TODO Ansible
***** TODO Docker
***** TODO Packer?
***** TODO Terraform?
*** TODO Create our first automation off of the generated starter image
*** TODO Setup an LXC to share out the zfs pool from Proxmox?
**** TODO How are we going to handle permissions on the shared out zfs pool
***** QUESTION Do I need to support anything outside of NFS?
