* Introduction

Catalyst is the kick off image that will start all other processes. The automation jobs will be ran from within catalyst.
As such, we need to build catalyst with all automation tools embedded.

* Current implementation

Catalyst will use docker to spin up and manage the installed applications on a targeting PROXMOX host.
